Task:  Install Node.js and verify the installation.

I can guide you through the process of installing Node.js and verifying the installation using the command line. 
Here's how you can install Node.js and verify the installation:

1. Download Node.js:
   Visit the official Node.js website at https://nodejs.org/. 
   On the homepage, you'll find the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version and the current version available for download. 
   Choose the LTS version for stability, or the current version for the latest features. 
   Click on the appropriate download link based on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. Install Node.js:
   Follow the installation instructions for your operating system. 
   Generally, for Windows and macOS, you'll download an installer and run it. 
   For Linux, you might use a package manager like `apt` or `yum` (on Ubuntu/Debian or CentOS/RHEL) or install it from the official NodeSource repository.

3. Verify Installation:
   After the installation is complete, you can verify it by opening a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) and typing the following commands:

   
   node -v
   npm -v
   

   - The `node -v` command will display the installed Node.js version.
   - The `npm -v` command will display the version of npm (Node Package Manager) that comes bundled with Node.js.

   If both commands show version numbers without any errors, then Node.js is successfully installed on your system.

   That's it! You've successfully installed Node.js and verified the installation.
